	<description><![CDATA[Deepl integration providing an translations through deepl.com with Nextcloud

This app integrates with [Nextcloud Assistant](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/assistant) to offer translation services We recommend to install Assistant additionally and activate Deepl as translation provider in the Artifical Intelligence admin settings.

This app also integrates with the translation API of Nextcloud server to offer translation services without Assistant. Currently this is available in Text and Talk.

To run translations and any other Task Processing tasks synchronously, run the following command in a background process (10 is the interval in seconds when the process should relaunch to use the latest php changes):

```sh
set -e; while true; do occ background-job:worker -v -t 10 "OC\TaskProcessing\SynchronousBackgroundJob"; done
```
