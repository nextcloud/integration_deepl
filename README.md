# Deepl.com integration for Nextcloud

This app integrates with [Nextcloud Assistant](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/assistant) to offer translation services We recommend to install Assistant additionally and activate Deepl as translation provider in the Artifical Intelligence admion settings.

This app also integrates with the translation API of Nextcloud server to offer translation services without Assistant. Currently this is available in text and Talk.

To run translations and any other Task Processing tasks synchronously, run the following command in a background process (10 is the interval in seconds when the process should relaunch to use the latest php changes):

```sh
set -e; while true; do occ background-job:worker -v -t 10 "OC\TaskProcessing\SynchronousBackgroundJob"; done
```

## Configuring

In the "Connected Accounts" section of the admin settings, the admin has the option to set the API key of the DeepL translation API.

Alternatively, you can run this command to set it:
```
occ config:app:set integration_deepl apikey --value="apikey"
```

In the "Artificial Intelligence" section of the admin settings, the admin can choose Deepl as the default provider for translations in Assistant in the "Task:Translate" option.

## üõ†Ô∏è State of maintenance

While there are many things that could be done to further improve this app, the app is currently maintained with **limited effort**. This means:

- The main functionality works for the majority of the use cases
- We will ensure that the app will continue to work like this for future releases and we will fix bugs that we classify as 'critical'
- We will not invest further development resources ourselves in advancing the app with new features
- We do review and enthusiastically welcome community PR's

We would be more than excited if you would like to collaborate with us. We will merge pull requests for new features and fixes. We also would love to welcome co-maintainers.

If there is a strong business case for any development of this app, we will consider your wishes for our roadmap. Please [contact your account manager](https://nextcloud.com/enterprise/) to talk about the possibilities.
